# UI Edition Emphasis Audit

## Overview

Audit the UI to ensure edition identity remains visually and structurally first-class.

Majestic must never visually collapse to “just movie.”

## Steps

1. Verify edition visible in detail view.
2. Ensure publisher_key consistently applied.
3. Confirm packaging drives frame material.
4. Ensure accent logic deterministic.
5. Detect generic fallback UI patterns.
